### Project Title: Food Delivery Management System

### Description:
It's a Java-based Food Delivery Management System, which provides an interactive GUI for managing food orders seamlessly between customers, restaurant staff, and delivery personnel. Built with Swing, it features role-based access, enabling customers to browse a menu with images, add items to their cart, view order status, and leave feedback. Restaurants can view incoming orders, update statuses, and receive feedback from customers. Delivery personnel can update delivery statuses, send messages to customers, and confirm deliveries. The system ensures synchronized data sharing, fostering efficient order processing and real-time updates among all stakeholders.
